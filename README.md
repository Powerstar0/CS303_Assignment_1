3) Choosing "1" will have the program ask for a number to check in the array. If found, it will return the index. If not, it will say that it's not found

4) Choosing "2" will ask you to select a valid index to modify and a number to replace the old value. It will then display both the old value and the new value at the index to the user. If either the index is out of range or a invalid input is entered, error messages will show.

5) Choosing "3" will ask you for a number to add to the array. If successful, it will respond to the user by saying the number was added to the array. Entering in an invalid input will spit out an error message.

6) Choosing "4" will ask you for the index of the number that you'd like to remove. The array will shift to compensate for the removal. It will also tell you what number was removed at that index.
