3) Choosing "1" will have the program ask for a number to check in the array. If found, it will return the index. If not, it will say that it's not found

4) Choosing "2" will ask you to select a valid index to modify and a number to replace the old value. It will then display both the old value and the new value at the index to the user. If either the index is out of range or a invalid input is entered, error messages will show.
